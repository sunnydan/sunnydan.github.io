Hello and welcome to the initial commit (AKA post), of my new devblog/web portfolio. Along with all the other social media sites, I'll be using the space to talk about programming, web development, game design, storytelling, the internet, and politics concerning those things. But first, a disclaimer: I did not make the layout of this website. It was made by the incomparable [Jarrekk](https://github.com/jarrekk). I am a bit too busy applying for jobs at the moment to code a nice website layout like this one, so thank you, Jarrekk. I don't expect to have any followers or anything read this, at least not until I somehow get famous, so if you're reading this, thank you as well. 

I'll sign off here for now, because it's late, and I don't have much else to say. Cya later.

-Daniel Hilla

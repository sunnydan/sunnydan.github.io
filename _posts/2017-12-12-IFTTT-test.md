Hello again. Today I'm testing out some integration with [IFTTT](ifttt.com). IFTTT is a website that allows users to set up connections between various online apps and services. For example, I am using it to make it so that whenever I make a new blog post on this website, that post will automatically be re-posted to my Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Google+ accounts. This saves me a lot of otherwise wasted time making posts on social media, which is important because I really need to be devoting as much time as possible to getting a job right now, but a big part of that is having a big online presence. Well, programming is all about finding ways to save time, so stuff like this is just par for the course.
